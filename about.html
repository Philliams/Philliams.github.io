I am a recent graduate of the University of Ottawa with a double major in Chemical Engineering and Computer Science. I think that the most interesting discoveries occur at the intersection of domains, and there is a lot of interesting research avenues combining Machine Learning with the natural sciences.

I am currently working at Kinaxis as a Machine Learning developer, and in my extra time I like to work on independant research as well as participating in all sorts of converences. I highly recommend checking out [CUSEC](http://2018.cusec.net) if you are in Canada, it is an awesome event for both professionals and students.

The main focus of my research has been on Machine Learning as well as Organic Electronics. I've worked on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing projects at IBM and Shopify respectively. I've also worked in [Dr. Benoit Lessard's lab](http://www.benoitlessard.com) and completed an Undergraduate Thesis involving computational chemistry and property prediction.
