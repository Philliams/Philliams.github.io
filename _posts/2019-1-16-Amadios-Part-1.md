title: Amadios - Part 1
---

A couple years ago, I worked on this really cool project called Amadios (a mashup of Amadeus Mozzart and iOS) for a demo competition. Basically, I made an iOS app that would take live audio and convert it to sheet music in real time. A lot of my friends and coworkers found this really cool, so I thought I'd make a series of blog posts explaining how this was accomplished.
