I"Œ<p>One of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms is Logistic Regression. At a conceptual level, thereâ€™s not much more to it than some simple calculus, but this algorithm can still be pretty effective in a lot of situations. In this post, weâ€™re going to take a little bit of a look at the math behind Logistic Regression and then implement our own Logistic Regression library in python.</p>
