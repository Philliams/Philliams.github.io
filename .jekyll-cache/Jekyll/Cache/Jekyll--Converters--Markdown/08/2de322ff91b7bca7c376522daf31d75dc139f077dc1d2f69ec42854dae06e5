I"<p>I’ve gotten a lot of questions on how to get a job as a student. Often students want to buff up their resumes or skills a few weeks before their interviews. Honestly, I don’t think there’s much you can do in less than a few months to improve your chances. Obviously you can review algorithms, practice questions and buff up you knowledge to give you a slight advantage, but if you really want to level up and give yourself the best chance at landing the type of jobs you want, you need to start at least 6 months in advance.</p>
