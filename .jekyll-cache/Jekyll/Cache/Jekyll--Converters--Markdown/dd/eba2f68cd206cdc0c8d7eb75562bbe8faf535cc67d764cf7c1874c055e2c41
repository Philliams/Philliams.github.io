<p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Ottawa with a double major in Chemical Engineering and Computer Science. I think that the most interesting discoveries occur at the intersection of domains, and there is a lot of interesting research avenues combining Machine Learning with the natural sciences.</p>

<p>I am currently working at Kinaxis as a Machine Learning developer, and in my extra time I like to work on independant research as well as participating in all sorts of converences. I highly recommend checking out <a href="http://2018.cusec.net">CUSEC</a> if you are in Canada, it is an awesome event for both professionals and students.</p>

<p>The main focus of my research has been on Machine Learning as well as Organic Electronics. Iâ€™ve worked on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing projects at IBM and Shopify respectively. Iâ€™ve also worked in <a href="http://www.benoitlessard.com">Dr. Benoit Lessardâ€™s lab</a> and completed an Undergraduate Thesis involving computational chemistry and property prediction.</p>
