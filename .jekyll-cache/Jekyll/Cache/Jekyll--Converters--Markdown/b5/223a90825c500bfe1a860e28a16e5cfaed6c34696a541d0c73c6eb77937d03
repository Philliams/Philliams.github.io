<p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Ottawa with a double major in Chemical Engineering and Computer Science. I think that the most interesting discoveries occur at the intersection of domains, and there is a lot of interesting research avenues combining Machine Learning with the natural sciences.</p>

<p>I am currently working at Kinaxis as a Machine Learning developer, and in my extra time I like to work on independant research as well as participating in all sorts of converences.</p>

<p>I had no idea what I wanted to do as a career, so I though picking two would give me a better chance of finding something that I would like. After completing my first semester and attending the student conference <a href="http://2018.cusec.net">CUSEC</a>, I realized that Computer Science was my passion but that the Chemistry side of my degree was still captivating.</p>

<p>My main focus has been on Machine Learning as well as Organic Electronics. I’ve worked on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing projects at IBM and Shopify respectively. I’ve also worked in <a href="http://www.benoitlessard.com">Dr. Benoit Lessard’s lab</a> and I am currently working on an Undergraduate Thesis involving computational chemistry.</p>
