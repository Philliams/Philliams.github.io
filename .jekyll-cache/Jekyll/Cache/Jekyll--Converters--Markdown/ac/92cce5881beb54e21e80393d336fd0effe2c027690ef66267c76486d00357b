I"©<p>One of the more interesting Machine Learning models is the Neural Network. A Neural Network is a highly non-linear mathmatical model that can be fitted to very complicated datasets, from image classification to text translation. In this blog post, weâ€™ll be implementing our own simple Neural Network library in python, then test how our model performs through a practical example on an image classification dataset.</p>
