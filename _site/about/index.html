  <h1>About</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>I am a fourth year student at the University of Ottawa pursuing a double major in Chemical Engineering and Computer Science. I had no idea what I wanted to do as a career, so I though picking two would give me a better chance of finding something that I would like. After completing my first semester and attending the student conference <a href="http://2018.cusec.net">CUSEC</a>, I realized that Computer Science was my passion but that the Chemistry side of my degree was still captivating.</p>

<p>My main focus has been on Machine Learning as well as Organic Electronics. I’ve worked on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing projects at IBM and Shopify respectively. I’ve also worked in <a href="http://www.benoitlessard.com">Dr. Benoit Lessard’s lab</a> and I am currently working on an Undergraduate Thesis involving computational chemistry.</p>

<p>In my spare time I like to participate in many exctracurriculars, such as being a member of the University of Ottawa fencing team or competing in Hackathons and Demo competitions.</p>
